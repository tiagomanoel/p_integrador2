## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Python 3.12+** (if not using Docker)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tiagomanoel/p_integrador2.git
   cd p_integrador2
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` File**

   ```bash
   POSTGRES_HOST=psql
   POSTGRES_PORT=5432
   POSTGRES_USER=your_user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. **Edit the `request_api.py` File**

   - Configure API settings in `scripts/request/request_api.py` as needed.

4. **Build the Docker Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Run the Django Application**

   ```bash
   docker-compose run djangoapp python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the Application**

   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## üì° API Usage

### Endpoint

The base URL for accessing the API is:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

To retrieve price data, you can use the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/?format=json
```

### Filtering Data

You can filter the data by passing the `currency` parameter in the query string. Available currency options for filtering include:

- **D√≥lar Americano/Real Brasileiro**: `USD-BRL`
- **D√≥lar Canadense/Real Brasileiro**: `CAD-BRL`
- **Euro/Real Brasileiro**: `EUR-BRL`
- **Libra Esterlina/Real Brasileiro**: `GBP-BRL`
- **Peso Argentino/Real Brasileiro**: `ARS-BRL`
- **Bitcoin/Real Brasileiro**: `BTC-BRL`
- **Litecoin/Real Brasileiro**: `LTC-BRL`
- **Iene Japon√™s/Real Brasileiro**: `JPY-BRL`
- **Franco Su√≠√ßo/Real Brasileiro**: `CHF-BRL`
- **D√≥lar Australiano/Real Brasileiro**: `AUD-BRL`
- **Yuan Chin√™s/Real Brasileiro**: `CNY-BRL`
- **Novo Shekel Israelense/Real Brasileiro**: `ILS-BRL`
- **Ethereum/Real Brasileiro**: `ETH-BRL`
- **XRP/Real Brasileiro**: `XRP-BRL`
- **Dogecoin/Real Brasileiro**: `DOGE-BRL`

For example, to get the most recent price for USD-BRL, use the following URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/?currency=USD-BRL&format=json
```

If you do not specify the `currency` parameter, the API will return the most recent 38 records for all currencies.

### Response Format

The API responds with data in JSON format. Here‚Äôs an example of a successful response:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "currency": "USD-BRL",
        "price": 5.25,
        "timestamp": "2024-10-27T12:00:00Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "currency": "USD-BRL",
        "price": 5.30,
        "timestamp": "2024-10-26T12:00:00Z"
    }
]
```

### Response Fields
- **id**: Unique identifier for the record.
- **currency**: The currency type (e.g., USD-BRL).
- **price**: The price value.
- **timestamp**: The date and time when the price was recorded.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuring Automatic Execution with `systemd`

### Step 1: Create a Startup Script

1. Navigate to the project directory (replace with your own path):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/
   ```

2. Create the `start_project.sh` script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose run djangoapp python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /path/to/your/project/start_project.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Create a `systemd` Service

1. Create a service file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/your_project.service
   ```

2. Add the following content (adjust paths accordingly):

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Start Django and Docker Project
   After=docker.service
   Requires=docker.service

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/path/to/your/project/start_project.sh
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project/
   Restart=always
   User=root

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Save and exit the editor.

### Step 3: Enable and Start the Service

1. Reload the `systemd` configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

2. Enable the service to start at boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable your_project.service
   ```

3. Start the service manually:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start your_project.service
   ```

### Step 4: Check Service Status

Check if the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status your_project.service
```

If everything is set up correctly, the service should show as "active (running)."

### Step 5: Reboot and Test

After setting up the service, you can reboot the server to test:

```bash
sudo reboot
```
